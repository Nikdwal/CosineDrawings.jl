Turn a set of sampled x and y values into a cosine series whose graph is a curve that follows the sampled x and y coordinates.
Run UnifiedCurve.jl to get an example.

- Use the methods in CosineSeries.jl to find a cosine series representation for a single sampled curve segment. You might not even need to use this module.
- Save the sampled curve segments (not the cosine series, but the x and y values you have sampled) in the file paths\_split. Refer to the comments in UnifiedCurve.jl for details.
- Walk through the code in UnifiedCurve.jl to unify different curve segments (or just one) into one equation and plot
